# Glass Catalog Buildout

A focused follow-up to Phase 2 of the chromatic dispersion overhaul ([CHROMATIC_DISPERSION_NOTES.md](../CHROMATIC_DISPERSION_NOTES.md)). The chromatic ray-trace now consults a Sellmeier glass catalog at [src/optics/glassCatalog.ts](../src/optics/glassCatalog.ts) when an element's `glass` string resolves to a known entry; otherwise it falls back to dPgF-corrected indices, measured `nC`/`nF`/`ng` line indices, or the legacy Abbe approximation.

The catalog currently has **149 verified entries** (38 after Phase 2, +15 in Phase 3 Apr 2026, +12 in Phase 4 Apr 2026, +27 in Phase 5 May 2026, +19 in Phase 6 May 2026, +4 in Phase 7 May 2026, +14 in Phase 8 May 2026, +20 in Phase 9 May 2026). This document is the playbook for further expansion. The bottleneck is not infrastructure — the dispersion engine, resolver, validator, and tests are all in place — it is the careful sourcing of vendor-published dispersion coefficients.

## Why So Few Entries To Start With

The first cut of the catalog had nine entries. Six were wrong: when the Sellmeier coefficients were validated against the listed `nd` at 587.5618 nm via `assertCatalogConsistent`, four diverged by 5e-3 to 2e-2 — well outside any reasonable transcription tolerance. The values came from memory and were unreliable.

The conclusion drove the design: **every entry must round-trip through `assertCatalogConsistent` (tolerance 1e-4) before being committed.** This is enforced by the unit test `every entry's Sellmeier coefficients reproduce the listed nd within 1e-4` in [__tests__/dispersion.test.ts](../__tests__/dispersion.test.ts). A bad transcription fails CI.

## Prioritized Glasses to Add

Frequency derived from `glass:` declarations across all 123 lens data files (1413 declarations total). The top 50 covers the lion's share. Asterisks mark entries already in the catalog.

**Phase 9 additions** (May 2026 — named-token coverage plus six-digit code-family backfill; all entries round-trip through `assertCatalogConsistent`):

| Glass | Vendor | Unlocks | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| ★ S-BSM16 | Ohara | 4 | Clean named-token match for nd≈1.62041 / νd≈60.29 annotations |
| ★ S-TIH13 | Ohara | 3 | Dense flint; new broad hits are now visible in mismatch reports when existing annotations were only approximate |
| ★ S-NBH53V | Ohara | 3 | Vacuum-melt NBH variant |
| ★ S-TIH23 | Ohara | 3 | Dense flint 785/263 |
| ★ N-SK5 | Schott | 3 | Legacy `SK5` alias added |

| ★ N-LAK14 | Schott | 2 | Lanthanum crown 697/554 |
| ★ E-FD2 | Hoya | 3 | Formula-3 dense flint 648/338 |
| ★ E-FD8 | Hoya | 2 | Formula-3 dense flint 689/312 |
| ★ TAFD35 | Hoya | 3 | Code-family 911353; resolves Nikon high-index lanthanum dense-flint annotations |
| ★ LAC13 | Hoya | 4 | Code-family 694533; discontinued special glass but Hoya AGF data is public |
| ★ S-LAH96 | Ohara | 4 | Code-family 764485; high-index lanthanum glass matching the patent nd/vd cluster |
| ★ H-ZF88 | CDGM | 2 | Named 946/180-class dense flint; official CDGM d-code is 946179, so code-only 946180 labels remain unresolved |
| ★ J-PSKH1 | Hikari | 10 | Code-family 593679; Hikari power-series entry, not a standard six-term polynomial |
| ★ J-PSKH4 | Hikari | 6 | Code-family 593670; Hikari power-series entry |
| ★ J-KZFH9 | Hikari | 4 | Code-family 738323; sourced from Hikari 2023 catalog |
| ★ J-LAK10 | Hikari | 3 | Code-family 720503; Hikari power-series entry |
| ★ J-LASFH9 | Hikari | 3 | Code-family 903357; older Hikari type now superseded by J-LASFH9A, but the 2012 catalog gives the exact d-code |
| ★ J-LASFH15 | Hikari | 2 | Code-family 950294; high-index dense flint |

Phase 9 deliberately left several high-frequency names unresolved: `S-BAL2`, `S-TIH10`, `S-LAM55`, `S-BSM28`, `S-BSM71`, `E-FD4`, `E-FD5`, and `TAF5` have public catalog constants that do not match the current lens annotations' nd/vd clusters closely enough for a safe broad resolver target. The remaining code-family priority queue is now led by `946180`, `744495`, `051269`, and a misleading `159319` token that appears to be shorthand for `1.59319/67.90` rather than a true six-digit d-code.

**Phase 8 additions** (May 2026 — clean named tokens from the unresolved-glass report; ambiguous high-frequency tokens such as NBFD3, S-NPH7, and TAFD25 remain deferred for per-lens patent relabeling):

|---|---|---:|---|
| ★ S-LAH93 | Ohara | 5 | High-index lanthanum; resolves repeated modern mirrorless annotations |

| ★ TAFD40 | Hoya | 3 | Formula-3 polynomial entry; supports nd≈2.00069 high-index APD surfaces |

**Phase 5 additions** (sourced from survey of unresolved glasses across all lens files, May 2026 — all from Ohara or Schott Zemax catalog via refractiveindex.info):

| ★ S-LAM2 | Ohara | 2 | Lanthanum crown |
| ★ N-SK10 | Schott | 2 | Barium crown; alias SK10 added |
| NBFD3 | Hoya | 8 | **Skip for direct add** — Hoya catalog NBFD3 is nd=1.80450/vd=39.63, but current annotations span several nd/vd regions; relabel or mark unmatched per lens first |

| S-TIF6 | Ohara | 2 | **Skip** — not in refractiveindex.info 2017 catalog |
| S-NPH7 | Ohara | 6 | **Skip for direct add** — public Ohara tables list S-NPH7 as nd=1.77830/vd=23.91, but current annotations use high-index nd≈2.0 values; needs per-lens relabeling |
| N-SK18 | Schott | 2 | **Skip** — not in refractiveindex.info 2017 catalog |

**Phase 4 additions not in the original table** (sourced from survey of 127 lens files, Apr 2026):

A handful of high-impact glasses (N-KZFS5, K-GFK68) appear infrequently but matter disproportionately for the marquee APO test cases the chromatic upgrade was designed to fix. Prioritize those alongside the high-frequency entries.

## Authoritative Sources Per Vendor

Use these in preference order. Always cite the source in the entry's `source` field.

### Schott — most accessible
1. **Schott Optical Glass Datasheet** — per-glass PDFs at [https://www.schott.com/en-gb/products/optical-glass](https://www.schott.com/en-gb/products/optical-glass). Each PDF lists the Sellmeier B1..B3 / C1..C3 plus the full nd, vd, and PgF.
2. **Schott catalogue Excel/CSV download** — same site, full catalog as a single file.
3. RefractiveIndex.INFO mirrors Schott data when the per-glass page exists.

### Ohara — primary vendor for this codebase
1. **Ohara Optical Glass Catalog** — full PDF catalogue at [https://www.oharacorp.com/](https://www.oharacorp.com/) (look under Resources/Downloads for the latest). Each glass's datasheet page lists the dispersion equation coefficients.
2. **Ohara per-glass datasheets** — the same site offers individual datasheets that list "Dispersion Equation Constants" (note: Ohara's are sometimes presented as "Schott-form" Sellmeier with B/C as in the standard formula, sometimes as Ohara's older form using A0..A5 — make sure you transcribe the standard six-coefficient form).
3. RefractiveIndex.INFO has many Ohara entries but coverage is uneven.

### Hoya
1. **Hoya Optical Glass Catalog** — at [https://www.hoya-opticalworld.com/english/datadownload/](https://www.hoya-opticalworld.com/english/datadownload/). Provides Sellmeier coefficients alongside the index/Abbe table.
2. Per-glass PDFs.

### Hikari / Nikon
1. **Nikon/Hikari optical glass catalog** — Nikon publishes current Hikari glass catalogs at [https://www.nikon.com/business/components/lineup/materials/optical-glass/](https://www.nikon.com/business/components/lineup/materials/optical-glass/). The PDF lists nd, νd, line indices, relative partial dispersions, six-digit d/e codes, and formula-3 power-series constants.
2. **Historical Hikari catalogs** — useful for discontinued types such as J-LASFH9 where the current catalog only lists the replacement J-LASFH9A. Prefer a vendor PDF when a d-code is absent from the refractiveindex.info YAML.
3. RefractiveIndex.INFO mirrors many Nikon/Hikari AGF entries, but some newer or discontinued pages are missing. Cross-check the vendor PDF before concluding no data exists.

### Sumita
1. **Sumita Optical Glass Catalog** — [https://www.sumita-opt.co.jp/en/products/optical-glass/](https://www.sumita-opt.co.jp/en/products/optical-glass/). Their PDF catalog includes Sellmeier constants for each K-prefix glass.

### CDGM
1. **CDGM Glass Catalog** — [http://www.cdgmgd.com/](http://www.cdgmgd.com/). Available as a PDF; English versions are slightly behind the Chinese release.

### Cross-reference (when a glass has multiple equivalents)
- Many Hoya/Ohara/Schott/CDGM glasses are catalog equivalents (e.g. N-BK7 ≈ S-BSL7 ≈ BSC7 ≈ H-K9L). Always source coefficients from the **vendor whose name the lens data uses**, even when an equivalent exists. Different vendors publish slightly different Sellmeier fits to nominally-equivalent melts.

### Refractiveindex.INFO — fast access to AGF data

Refractiveindex.INFO mirrors the vendor-published AGF (Zemax catalog) files, which is convenient when the vendor's own download portal is awkward or behind a registration wall. The site's per-glass UI URLs (`?shelf=glass&book=...&page=...`) render via JavaScript and are not fetchable headlessly. The underlying data files **are** fetchable:

- **Catalog index** (lists every glass and its data path):
  `https://refractiveindex.info/database/catalog-nk.yml`
- **Per-glass spec file** (Sellmeier coefficients, nd, vd, ΔPgF, glass_code):
  `https://refractiveindex.info/database/data/specs/<vendor>/optical/<NAME>.yml`
  - Ohara: `specs/ohara/optical/S-PHM52.yml`, etc.
  - Schott: `specs/schott/optical/N-BK7.yml`
  - Hoya: `specs/hoya/optical/FCD1.yml`
  - Sumita: `specs/sumita/optical/K-GFK68.yml`
  - To find the right path for a glass not listed above, grep the catalog index: `curl -sL https://refractiveindex.info/database/catalog-nk.yml | grep -A1 "PAGE: <NAME>"`.

The YAML's `DATA[].coefficients` field for `type: formula 2` (Sellmeier-1, Zemax form) is laid out as **seven** numbers: `K B1 C1 B2 C2 B3 C3`. K is the additive constant in `n² = K + Σ Bᵢλ²/(λ²−Cᵢ)`; for the standard Sellmeier-1 form K=0 (verify before transcribing). Then map straight into the catalog entry's `B: [B1, B2, B3]` and `C: [C1, C2, C3]` arrays.

For `type: formula 3` (Zemax polynomial / power series), do **not** force the values into `B`/`C`. If the exponents are exactly `0, 2, -2, -4, -6, -8`, store the six terms in `polynomial: [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]` where `n² = a0 + a1·λ² + a2·λ⁻² + a3·λ⁻⁴ + a4·λ⁻⁶ + a5·λ⁻⁸`. If the source uses explicit exponents outside that fixed shorthand, such as Hikari entries with `λ⁴`, `λ⁻¹⁰`, or `λ⁻¹²`, store them in `powerSeries: [[coefficient, exponent], ...]` exactly as published. The d-line consistency test covers both forms.

PgF is **not** published in the rii.info YAML (only `dPgF` is). Compute PgF for the catalog entry from the Schott normal-line baseline plus dPgF: `PgF ≈ 0.6438 − 0.001682·vd + dPgF`. The catalog's PgF field is decorative — the dispersion engine derives V-channel partial dispersion from the lens-data element's `dPgF`, not from the catalog. If you need vendor-direct PgF (rare), pull from the OHARA/Schott PDF datasheet instead.

The 1e-4 round-trip test will catch any transcription error — never relax the tolerance, fix the source.

## How to Add an Entry — Step by Step

1. **Find the glass in the source vendor's catalog** (PDF, datasheet, or downloaded Excel). Confirm whether the formula is standard six-coefficient Sellmeier:
   $$n^2(\lambda) = 1 + \frac{B_1 \lambda^2}{\lambda^2 - C_1} + \frac{B_2 \lambda^2}{\lambda^2 - C_2} + \frac{B_3 \lambda^2}{\lambda^2 - C_3}$$
   with λ in **micrometres** and C in **micrometres²**, or Zemax formula 3 polynomial as described above. Reject any other formula until you have explicitly converted it.

2. **Transcribe** the coefficients verbatim into a new entry in `RAW_CATALOG` in [src/optics/glassCatalogData.ts](../src/optics/glassCatalogData.ts). Keep all digits the source publishes — typically 8–10 significant figures.

3. **Fill in `nd` and `vd`** from the same vendor's published table (not from the lens data file). Provide `PgF` if listed and `code6` if it's a Schott-style 6-digit code.

4. **Cite the source** in the `source` field with enough detail to find it again ("Schott N-FK5 datasheet, Schott AG public, accessed YYYY-MM-DD" or "Ohara optical glass catalog 2024 v3, page N-LAK glasses").

5. **Run the consistency test:**
   ```bash
   npm test -- dispersion.test.ts
   ```
   The first test (`every entry's Sellmeier coefficients reproduce the listed nd within 1e-4`) fails immediately on a bad transcription, naming the offending glass and the diff. Tighten the value or fix the source — never relax the tolerance.

6. **If the glass has a common informal alias** (`BSC7` for `S-BSL7`, `BK7` for `N-BK7`) add it to the `ALIASES` map.

7. **If you've added enough entries** that the LCA readout for the target lens has visibly changed, update [CHROMATIC_DISPERSION_NOTES.md](../CHROMATIC_DISPERSION_NOTES.md) with the new state and add a changelog entry per [agent_docs/changelog.md](changelog.md).

## Pitfalls and Edge Cases

- **Ohara's older "Dispersion Equation"** uses A0..A5 in a different functional form (a polynomial in λ², not a sum of Sellmeier terms). Their modern datasheets publish the standard Sellmeier — confirm you have the right one. The standard form has six numbers, three of which (C1..C3) carry units of μm².
- **λ units.** Some sources tabulate in nm rather than μm. The standard is μm; the catalog evaluator (`evaluateSellmeier`) converts the input nm to μm internally. If a source gives C values around `1e6`, that's in nm² and must be divided by `1e6` before insertion.
- **CaF2 and other crystals** sometimes use a different Sellmeier formulation (e.g. Daimon & Masumura). Convert to the standard form or note the deviation and provide a custom evaluator.
- **Anisotropic crystals** (sapphire, lithium niobate) have wavelength-dependent indices that differ along ordinary vs. extraordinary axes. None are present in the current lens data; this concern is forward-looking only.
- **Vacuum-melt variants** (suffix V or VS, e.g. S-LAH55V, S-LAH55VS) have slightly different coefficients from their non-V forms. Treat as distinct entries.
- **Discontinued glasses** (e.g. some "BAL" and old "F"-series Schott) may not appear in current PDFs. Use the last historical Schott catalog (search "Schott Optical Glass 2014" or earlier) — the coefficients of discontinued glasses are still physical fact.
- **Six-digit codes are not vendor names.** They encode rounded nd/νd and can describe equivalent glasses from multiple makers. Prefer a vendor-canonical name when the lens annotation includes one; for code-only patent labels, only add a `code6` mapping when the sourced catalog constants match the stored patent nd/vd cluster closely.
- **Not every six-digit-looking token is a glass code.** Strings like `159319/6790` may be compact nd/vd shorthand (`1.59319 / 67.90`) rather than a d-code. Relabel those annotations before adding catalog aliases.

## When to Stop

The catalog never needs to be exhaustive. Diminishing returns kick in after the top 30 entries — beyond that, each new glass affects fewer than 10 elements across the entire lens library. Stop adding new entries when:

1. The headline regression cases (Voigtländer APO-Lanthar 50/2, Leica APO 35/2 / 43/2) hit Sellmeier on every glass surface.
2. `summarizeDispersionQuality(L)` returns `"sellmeier"` (not `"abbe"`) for the great majority of catalog lenses.
3. Remaining unmatched glasses are genuinely proprietary (Sumita unidentified, "anomalous high-index flint" without a catalog name), or are catalog names used inconsistently across multiple nd/vd regions (notably NBFD3, TAFD25, and the current S-NPH7 annotations), or are absent from the rii.info 2017 archive — those should be resolved per lens or backfilled with patent-published `nC`/`nF`/`ng`.

For per-lens audits that consume the catalog (relabeling, mismatch resolution, `dPgF`/line-index enrichment), follow [lens-patent-audit.md](lens-patent-audit.md).
